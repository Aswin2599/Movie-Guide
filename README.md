# Movie-Guide

The entertainment industry has been changed by a paradigm shift from traditional cable television to on-demand streaming platforms. The impact of OTT platforms and streaming services on movies is clear, but that does not limit the growth options for either side. Companies like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and others have put massive libraries of content at our fingertips. However, with this change comes a new dilemma for the end user. Because of the large number of streaming platforms available people frequently vary their subscriptions to get a broader range of material. However, when it comes to finding a certain movie or going into a specific genre, the work gets difficult. The user must tediously switch platforms, typing the same search terms and combing through the results.

IMDB and other similar platforms sought to fill this void by providing information on where to watch films online., Nonetheless, while their broad brush approach is helpful, it lacks personalization. A user may become frustrated if they realize that a movie is offered on a platform to which they are not subscribing. I began to put effort into addressing this glaring gap in user experience by creating a website that allows consumers to search for content across only the streaming services they use. The primary goal was to reduce clutter by displaying results that were tailored to each user's subscription profile.


Our main contribution is to provide a user-centric approach to content search. Our website gives search results personalized to each user by incorporating a system that tracks and considers individual subscription data. This website will integrate with several streaming systems, application programming interfaces (API), or data streams from various platforms to do this. API is a broad name for a software middleman that allows programs to communicate with one another. However, as time went on, the modern API evolved some distinguishing characteristics that altered the technical scene. To begin, modern APIs adhere to standards (often HTTP and REST) [6]. Our platform is supported by two major components: A dynamic search platform and a database backend which is enriched with movie listings from various platforms, and a user database which is used to fetch information to which they have access. To achieve this feedback was critical and continuous unit testing was done to improve.
In conclusion, While the projectâ€™s basis addresses a common pain issue, its power rests in additional layers of user experience augmentation. Intends to reimagine how users engage with their plethora of streaming subscriptions by focusing on personalized search results and fortifying the platform with advanced capabilities.
